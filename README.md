My name is Adam Radford. I grew up in Beaverton, Oregon - which is right next to Portland. I served my mission on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona from 2015 to 2016. I am a Data Science major. My wife and I were married in the Meridian, Idaho Temple in October of 2020. I like Science fiction and table top role playing games.
